1. Install nvm (found https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#readme)
2. Install node.js and npm via nvm
3. If you wish to make a similar project, do: npm create vite@latest and then enter project name and enter tech stack
4. Then go to Github, create a new repository w/ no readme or gitignore
5. Then cd into the directory of your new react app
6. Then enter the following: git init, git init, git add README.md, git commit -m "first commit", git branch -M main, git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/[reponame], git push -u origin main
