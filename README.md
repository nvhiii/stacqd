## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js + Vite
- Node.js (v18+)
- TypeScript + JS
- Firebase (OAuth)
- local dotenv configuration for sensitive data

### Installation

1. Install nvm (found https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#readme)
2. Install node.js and npm via nvm
3. If you wish to make a similar project, do: npm create vite@latest and then enter project name and enter tech stack
4. Then go to Github, create a new repository w/ no readme or gitignore
5. Then cd into the directory of your new react app
6. Then enter the following: git init, git init, git add README.md, git commit -m "first commit", git branch -M main, git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/[reponame], git push -u origin main
   \*\* SSH key works a little weird w/ access, so I recommend https
7. Now the react app is set up with github! Congrats.

### Execution

Backend

- npm run dev in root dir for backend functionality testing (will show successful API connectivity + port 3000)
  Frontend
- cd client
- npm run dev (will show index.html via index.tsx and app.tsx on port 5173)
